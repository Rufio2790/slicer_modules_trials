MIP on Plane: MIP algorithm has already been implemented in Slicer (Volume Rendering modules, Techniques). 
This module allows the 3D volume rendering using the MIP, but there is still no module that allows the projection 
on a plane.
    i.	Implement a module that projects the vessels through MIP on a specific plane
    ii.	Allow to modify the slab (thickness) of the volume considered during MIP
    iii.	Visualize this volume in a Slicer widget (red, yellow or green)
